## PHP library to draw charts

This library allows you to create images of charts using PHP. It's specially useful when you need to create charts on the server-side 
and so you can't use a front-end library such as Highcharts.

This library is is based on the original work of [Jean-Marc TrÃ©meaux](http://naku.dohcrew.com/) (check the [original website](https://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/)).
Also used the fork from [Alexander Stehlik](https://github.com/astehlik).

````php
$chart = new ChartVerticalBar(600, 300);

$dataSet = new XYDataSet();
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("Feb", 3296));
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("Mar", -1816));
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("Apr", 687));
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("May", 10987));
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("Jun", 8014));
$dataSet->addPoint(new Point("Jul", 7695));

$chart->setDataSet($dataSet);
$chart->setTitle("Values");

header("Content-type: image/png");
$chart->render();

# Installation

Require the package in your `composer.json` file and update composer, using the following data:

```php
"luismarto/libchart": "1.*"
```

# Documentation

At this point documentation is scarce and the most you can get is by reading code.
It's my intention to fully document the package and it's options, but first I want to refactor a few things.

# Roadmap

In a forseable future (v 1.5 / 1.6).
- Make the package more "configurable"
- Fix bugs on Pie and Line charts
- Rename some classes and review the package's structure
- Refactor the bootstrap code, so you don't need to include so many classes
- Fix tests and demo

In a near future (v 2.0)
- Refactor the core (Plot and Chart) and remove duplicate code
- Make this easily integrated with Laravel
