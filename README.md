## PHP library to draw charts

Phpopenchart was based on Libchart and allows you to create charts using PHP. It's specially useful when you need to create charts on the server-side 
and so you can't use a front-end library such as Highcharts.

````php
use Phpopenchart\Chart\Column;

$chart = new Column([
    'chart' => [
        'width' => 1000,
        'height' => 300,
    ],
    'title' => [
        'text' => 'Values'
    ],
    'dataset' => [
        'series' => ['Product A', 'Product B', 'Product C'],
        'labels' => ['Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul'],
        'data' => [
            [3296, 4852, 2010, 6004, 5014, 7695],
            [2036, 1816, 687, 1025, 3074, 3651],
            [123, 984, 102, 707, 853, 696],
        ]
    ]
]);

$chart->render();

In a forseable future
- Minor fixes and improvements (add configurations, apply configurations to all chart types, optimize internal code, add the color specified on the point to the pie chart, ...)
- Fully document label-axis and value-axis as well as the new "align" configurations. The same for the 'ratio' property
- Update documentation for the exception created
- Remove method `getPalette` from `AbstractChart`
- Make this easily integrated with Laravel
