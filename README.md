## PHP library to draw charts

This library allows you to create images of charts using PHP. It's specially useful when you need to create charts on the server-side 
and so you can't use a front-end library such as Highcharts.

This library is is based on the original work of [Jean-Marc TrÃ©meaux](http://naku.dohcrew.com/) (check the [original website](https://naku.dohcrew.com/libchart/pages/introduction/)).
Also used the fork from [Alexander Stehlik](https://github.com/astehlik).

````php
use Libchart\Chart\Column;

header("Content-type: image/png");

$chart = new Column([
    'width' => 600,
    'height' => 300,
    'title' => [
        'text' => 'Values'
    ],
    'dataset' => [
        ["Feb", 3296],
        ["Mar", -1816],
        ["Apr", 687],
        ["May", 10987],
        ["Jun", 8014],
        ["Jul", 7695],
    ]
